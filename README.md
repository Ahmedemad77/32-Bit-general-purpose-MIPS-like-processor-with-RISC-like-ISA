# 32-Bit-general-purpose-MIPS-like-processor-with-RISC-like-ISA

Code of the processor is written using *VHDL* then 
synthesized and implemented on Xilinx ISE program. The processor is then tested with simple factorial calculator on 
simulation in Xilinx ISE program it consists of 3 main parts
- VHDL
- assembler
- PCB
